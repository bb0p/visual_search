This is a matlab script for conducting and analyzing linguistically mediated visual search experiment as mentioned in:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11476093

The strength of the script is that it is that displays are created randomly according to a handful of parameters. We used it for 3 different experiments with about 30 subjects in each, with larger and larger set-sizes, to test whether the experimental results would be as predicted by our simulations. But the point in this context is just that setting up a new experiment was as easy as changing the numbers in the script.
